Tool to convert kindle notes file to Evernote notes

## Disclaimer

This is mostly a project to play around with Elixir and learn it on something real.
So there are probably lots of things that can be improved.

## Pre-requisites

The application uses ENScript on Windows, so you need to have Evernote installed.

## Build the project

```Shell
mix escript.build
```
