**Discontinued**

⚠️ With Evernote v10 Windows client, there is no more ENScript utility, therefore this project cannot work anymore.
This repository is now archived.

Tool to convert kindle notes file to Evernote notes

## Disclaimer

This is mostly a project to play around with Elixir and learn it on something real.
So there are probably lots of things that can be improved.

## Pre-requisites

The application uses ENScript on Windows, so you need to have Evernote installed.

## Build the project

```Shell
mix escript.build
```

## Run

```Shell
./kindlenotes2evernote --file="My Clippings.txt"
```
